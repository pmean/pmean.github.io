### General information
    
This file was created by Steve Simon using R Markdown on 2020-01-04 and last updated on `r Sys.Date()`. You can find the [source code](https://github.com/classes-medb/classes-medb.github.io/blob/master/5508-overview.Rmd) on my github repository, [classes-medb](https://github.com/classes-medb).

This class is taught using the Canvas learning management system. Access to Canvas is limited to me and students currently enrolled. If you have access, the main page for the Canvas site for Spring Semester 2020 is found [here](https://umkc.instructure.com/courses/58364).

The resources on this website will be generally consistent with those on Canvas. If you find any major discrepancies, please bring them to my attention. The information on Canvas takes precedence over the information presented here.

### Syllabus

The syllabus is available on [Canvas]() or in [html format](5505-syllabus.html). These should be identical, but if there are any discrepancies, the Canvas site takes precedence.

### Assignments, due start of week 3, `r mon(3)`

Adapt the small program to run on your computer.

Graded: 3 points, one point deducted if submitted late.

Download the code for small-program.Rmd and the datafile two-small-dataframes.RData(../data/two-small-dataframes.RData) and store the files in a src and data directory somewhere on your computer. Modify the code so that you are listed as the author. Run the program and submit it as a PDF file.

If there are errors or warnings in your output, make your best effort to fix them, but getting anything to run, even something with error messages will be sufficient for this very first homework assignment.
