### General Policies for UMKC Courses

#### Will I be dropped from class if I not attend class?  What happens if I do not attend class without communicating with my instructor?
+ Maintaining accurate enrollment records throughout the term is a partnership between instructors and students.  Instructors are responsible for verifying student attendance and participation within the first three weeks (16 week course) through the Attendance Verification Survey (administered through UMKC Connect) as well as maintain records of participation throughout the term so that the last date of attendance for students with recorded "F" or "W" final grades may be submitted.  Because student plans for enrollment sometimes change prior to the semester start, students not engaging in courses through the initial weeks of each course may be administratively dropped.

#### How do I get permission before recording class sessions?
+ Instructor(s) may record class sessions for the sole purpose of sharing the recording with students who can't attend class. Instructor(s) will take care not to disclose personally identifiable information from the student education records during the recorded lesson. Students are not permitted to record class sessions without written consent from the course instructor.

#### Is there Recommended Technology that I should have access to?
+ You will need access to the computing resources necessary to complete this course through personal and/or University channels (e.g., computer labs). Our course will take place within the Canvas LMS and utilizing various software technologies that facilitate interaction and communication. We can make alternate arrangements should your reason for being without computer access warrant an accommodation (note: travel for vacation/work does not necessitate accommodations).  Below is a list of some helpful computer requirements for full participation in this online class: the latest version of Java; the latest version of QuickTime; the latest version of Adobe Reader; a current version of word processing software or a text editing program; a headset with microphone; a webcam; Google Chrome, Firefox, or Edge for Windows computers; Google Chrome, Firefox, or Safari for Apple computers.
