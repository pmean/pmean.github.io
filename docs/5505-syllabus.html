<h3>Discussion Board Guidelines - General Information</h3>
<p>The purpose of the discussion board forum is to engage students in
applying the concepts of this course in an exchange of ideas and
opinions that is open, honest, and that stimulates transference of ideas
to your own area of expertise and interest. Discussion board
conversations also serve to build a sense of community among students in
the class for the purpose of examining how the concepts we are studying
are relevant to our own experiences. In the best tradition of the value
of learning from each other, the following guidelines should guide us
all as we participate in these discussions:</p>
<p>Participants should listen to others respectfully. Remember that when
communicating via the computer screen, you do not have the benefit of
voice intonation, facial expressions, body language or gestures to
interpret the meaning behind the words. The same words spoken orally in
different manners can mean different things. Remember this and give the
person the benefit of the doubt when interpreting discussion board
posts. Take your responsibilities seriously and offer meaningful
feedback. Disagreements should focus on ideas and concepts, not the
individual posting to the discussion board. If you disagree with what
another student has written, strive to critique ideas in a respectful
and constructive manner. When a disagreement occurs, attempt to
understand other person’s perspectives rather than to simply criticize
them. Treat other students with the same respect and courtesy that
promotes the same thoughtful and fair treatment that is supportive of
face to face discussions.</p>
<p>Intervene politely if someone is being disrespectful or unfair to
others. If you find something on the Discussion Board that strikes you
as unacceptable in either tone or content, gently share your concern
with the poster AND be sure to let the course instructor know about it
as soon as possible Usually this kind of thing is the result of some
kind of accident or misunderstanding, and I will make sure that it gets
cleared up as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Keep the content of posts relevant to the topic. While the tone of
your posts may be informal and genial, the discussion board is not a
chat room. If necessary for personal messages, please use Mail or other
forms of direct contact.</p>
<p>Use language, spelling and grammar that are appropriate to an
educational setting. Avoid use of overly technical or discipline
specific language, slang or Internet shorthand, and remember to
proofread work prior to posting it for the class to read. Strive for
proper spelling and grammar. Use complete sentences. Do not “shout”
(i.e., type in capital letters).</p>
<p>Read and Reply. Note that your replies to others are just as
important as the expression of your own initial thoughts about the
topic. Take time to read what others have written and to give them
relevant feedback when appropriate. Even if you have completed the
requirements for posting in a given week, go back and see what others
have written since you were last there.</p>
<p>Please be sure to bring any problems or suggestions regarding
effective and courteous use of the discussion board to the attention of
the course director.</p>
<h3>Statement on Expectations Regarding Student Conduct</h3>
<p>In order to maintain a proper learning environment within the class,
it is important for all students enrolled in this course to treat both
the faculty and their peers with courtesy, civility and respect. Conduct
for which students are subject to sanctions includes academic
dishonesty, such as cheating, plagiarism, or sabotage.</p>
<p>Students whose behavior is deemed disruptive by their instructor may
be told to leave the classroom for the remainder of the session. Zero
participation points will be earned for any weekly discussion activities
when a student is told to leave the discussion.</p>
<p>Please refer to the UM System standard of conduct for more
information.</p>
<h3>Academic honesty</h3>
<p>The Board of Curators of the University of Missouri recognizes that
academic honesty is essential for the intellectual life of the
University. Faculty members have a special obligation to expect high
standards of academic honesty in all student work. Students have a
special obligation to adhere to such standards. Academic dishonesty,
including cheating, plagiarism or sabotage, is adjudicated through the
University of Missouri Student Conduct Code and Rules of Procedures in
Student Conduct Matters.</p>
<p>Conduct for which students are subject to sanctions includes academic
dishonesty, such as cheating, plagiarism, or sabotage. In the event
misconduct is confirmed, the students will receive 0 points on the exam
or assignment. If academic dishonesty is admitted or confirmed by
evidence the faculty are required to report the incident to the
Assistant Dean for Graduate Studies, who will meet with the faculty
member and student to review the event and then determine whether it
should be further referred to the Dean of the School of Graduate
Studies.</p>
<p>Students enrolled in this course assume an obligation to behave in a
manner compatible with the University’s function as an educational
institution as described in the University Collected Rules and
Regulations Chapter 200 Student Conduct, section 200.010 Standard of
Conduct. Conduct for which students are subject to sanctions includes
academic dishonesty, such as cheating, plagiarism, or sabotage. Conduct
for which students are subject to sanctions are outlined as follows:</p>
<p>The term cheating includes but is not limited to: (i) use of any
unauthorized assistance in taking quizzes, tests, or examinations; (ii)
dependence upon the aid of sources beyond those authorized by the
instructor in writing papers, preparing reports, solving problems, or
carrying out other assignments; (iii) acquisition or possession without
permission of tests or other academic material belonging to a member of
the University faculty or staff; or (iv) knowingly providing any
unauthorized assistance to another student on quizzes, tests, or
examinations.</p>
<p>The term plagiarism includes, but is not limited to: (i) use by
paraphrase or direct quotation of the published or unpublished work of
another person without fully and properly crediting the author with
footnotes, citations or bibliographical reference; (ii) unacknowledged
use of materials prepared by another person or agency engaged in the
selling of term papers or other academic materials; or (iii)
unacknowledged use of original work/material that has been produced
through collaboration with others without release in writing from
collaborators. In addition, the Department of Biomedical and Health
Informatics includes self-plagiarism in their expanded definition.</p>
<p>Self-plagiarism is reuse of an existing paper that has been submitted
for credit in a different course without prior discussion and consent of
the course director.</p>
<p>The term sabotage includes, but is not limited to, the unauthorized
interference with, modification of, or destruction of the work or
intellectual property of another member of the University community.</p>
<p>To ensure academic integrity and prevent plagiarism, UMKC has
purchased the Internet-based Turn It In. This site allows faculty and
students to submit papers online to examine a paper’s originality. The
site compares submitted papers with several proprietary algorithm
databases to check for plagiarism. The course director reserves the
right to have student assignments reviewed on Turnitin.com in this
course. Submissions will have all identifying student information (name,
student ID number etc.) removed from the submission to ensure that
student’s rights are protected.</p>
<p>Academic Inquiry, Course Discussion and Privacy: University of
Missouri System Executive Order No. 38 lays out principles regarding the
sanctity of classroom discussions at the university. The policy is
described fully in Section 200.015 of the Collected Rules and
Regulations. In this class, students may make audio or video recordings
of course activity unless specifically prohibited by the faculty member.
However, the redistribution of any audio or video recordings of
statements or comments from the course to individuals who are not
students in the course is prohibited without the express permission of
the faculty member and of any students who are recorded, including those
recordings prepared by an instructor. Students found to have violated
this policy are subject to discipline in accordance with provisions of
Section 200.020 of the Collected Rules and Regulations of the University
of Missouri pertaining to student conduct matters.</p>
<h3>Attendance Policy</h3>
<p>Students are expected to attend and participate in classes. Advance
notice of attendance policies of academic units and individual
instructors should be given, and such notice should be in writing.
Students should notify instructors of excused absences in advance, where
possible. Students who have an excused absence are expected to make
arrangements with instructors for alternative or make-up work. Such
arrangements should be made in advance of the absence, where possible.
Instructors should accommodate excused absences to the extent that an
accommodation can be made that does not unreasonably interfere with the
learning objectives of the course or unduly burden the instructor.
Attendance policies shall be applied in a non-discriminatory manner.</p>
<h3>Discrimination</h3>
<p>The course faculty is committed to creating and maintaining a
supportive learning environment. If at any time you find yourself in an
environment that does not support learning, it is best to first contact
the course faculty. If faculty members are unable to resolve the
situation for you, you may contact: the Chair of the Department, the
Associate Dean for Student Affairs, Dr. Brenda Rogers, SOM Rm M4-207, <a href="mailto:rogersbr@umkc.edu" class="email">rogersbr@umkc.edu</a>,

<h3>Grade Appeal Policy</h3>
<p>Students are responsible for meeting the standards of academic
performance established for each course in which they are enrolled. The
establishment of the criteria for grades and the evaluation of student
academic performance are the responsibilities of the instructor.</p>
<p>The University grade appeal procedure is available only for the
review of allegedly capricious grading and not for review of the
instructor’s evaluation of the student’s academic performance.
Capricious grading, as that term is used here, comprises any of the
following:</p>
<p>The assignment of a grade to a particular student on some basis other
than the performance in the course;</p>
<p>The assignment of a grade to a particular student according to more
exacting or demanding standards than were applied to other students in
the course; (Note: Additional or different grading criteria may be
applied to graduate students enrolled for graduate credit in 300- and
400-level courses.)</p>
<p>The assignment of a grade by a substantial departure from the
instructor’s previously announced standards.</p>
<p>Students who have concerns about this course should first consult
with the specific instructor with whom there is a problem. If the issues
are not satisfactorily resolved the student should contact the course
director.</p>
<p>In the event a student would like to appeal a course grade they must
follow the School of Medicine procedure for grade appeal for graduate
courses, which is outlined in the student handbook or can be found at
the School of Medicine Graduate Council web page.</p>
